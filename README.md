# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Final requirement in https://www.boot.dev/lessons/7b6379ff-8a74-45fe-8084-a79f9680a371

What it does:
Bookbot reads a text file and does basic quantitative analysis on it.
The resulting report outputs the file path, word count, and letter count.

Other stuff:
- the letter count is not case sensitive
- this is the first use of the sys package so the script can be run on a cli with relative pathing
- book resources taken from https://www.gutenberg.org/ (in .gitignore)

Use syntax:
python3 main.py books/bookname.txt
